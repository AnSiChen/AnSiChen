- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnSiChen
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Learning, music, languages and computers, and I have a love for machine learning, AI, robotics, and anything space related, and I would like to pursue a career in such fields. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. But after that, I still want to add more, that is just my basic list for now. Admittedly starting, but I will trust myself on this one and not only try my best but make coding my main thing in life, at least for now until I manage to work out the basics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...  Learning, not yet in the collaborating part I guess, I want to focus on the new things I have in mind, and anyways being honest, not prepared yet for anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ... is there a way to reach me on here if so, do it if there is anything you would like to tell me, I want to make friends? I'm too new for this. Maybe reach me on IG... (Which I have conveniently left out haha)

- Proficient: English， Chinese Mandarin 简体中文， Spanish.
- Still learning: Norwegian, french, and Korean.
- Hello, Universe 🌟
